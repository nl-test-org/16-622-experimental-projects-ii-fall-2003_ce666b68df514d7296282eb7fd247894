Lectures on relevant topics are covered in [16.621](/courses/16-621-experimental-projects-i-spring-2003), so the 16.622 schedule includes very few formal meetings. In 16.622, students have class only twice during the semester although they attend team meetings with the faculty and weekly meetings with their advisor. Throughout the semester, students mainly work independently to complete the design of their experiment conceived in 16.621.
