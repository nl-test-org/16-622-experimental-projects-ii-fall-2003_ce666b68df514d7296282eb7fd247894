Students beginning 16.622 must have completed a Design Proposal in 16.621, during the previous semester, in order to proceed. Having completed the design proposal in advance, student teams in 16.622 devote their time to setting up, conducting, and concluding their experiments in the time allotted. They are required to report on their progress in a number of ways. Formally, mid-term and final oral reports must be delivered, and a final report must be submitted. Samples of these reports, along with each team's 16.621 Design Proposal (with which they began 16.622), are included in this section.
